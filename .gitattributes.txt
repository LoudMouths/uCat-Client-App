level transitions:

- 2 audios playing (when not doing from menu)
- menu board remains open
- level 2 teleports randomly (dialogue index issue)


general: 

cannot currently have dialogue options after task is finished (should be able to just continue dialogue indexes?)

intro: 


level 1: 

timer doesnt start for skip
word stays on 'help' at the end, should be blank when asking to go to next level 

2:

wit deactivates during next/repeat bit at end of level

  - Hi! I'm so glad to see you made it this far!
  - I'm uCat, your AI guide for your BCI. I'll take you through the calibration program.
  - 'For the past few weeks you practiced repeating a ton of words. '
  - I think it's time you learn how to use them to your advantage.
  - As usual, try to repeat the phrase when the text turns green.
  - Imagine you are mouthing the words to someone across the room.
  - This time however I will play your inner voice back to you.
  - 'When the phrase turns green, try to repeat after me:'
